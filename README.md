my project (stopwatch) in an embedded system
which uses layers design like (Mcal-hal-app) and uses atmega32 microcontroller
the basic idea behind a stopwatch is to count_down the time that the user puts in
I used four buttons one for the minutes, one for the second, one for the start
and one for the reset
then when I put the time and finish counting down, the buzzer will start an alarm and appear message including "time is over"
components
1. lcd
2. buttons
3. buzzer
